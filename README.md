### Requirements

You'll need to install python 3.6 (*Or newer*) available from https://www.python.org/

## Usage
- **Install python if you haven't yet**


1. Download the `main.py` file
2. Double click on `main.py` to run it
3. enter the length of the string you need
4. Paste the string to anywhere you need it. *(The result is copied for you automatically)*

You can also run the code via the **CMD**/**Terminal** by using the command:
`python3 (directory of file)/main.py`

#### Notes
This is a quick programme I made for generating test data for my controlled assessment. I will not be offering assistance to use this tool as it was ment for personal use.
